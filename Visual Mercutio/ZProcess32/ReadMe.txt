MFCDRAG shows how to implement drag and drop between a CListCtrl and 
CTreeCtrl.  The program creates a splitter window with four panes.  Two 
panes contain CListCtrls and the other two contain CTreeCtrls.  You can 
drag an item from any window to another.  Dragging can occur from:

CListCtrl to CTreeCtrl
CListCtrl to CListCtrl
CTreeCtrl to CListCtrl
CTreeCtrl to CTreeCtrl
